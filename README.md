### Overview

The Lookbook Interactive Feature is built using **Liquid**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**. It integrates seamlessly with the Shopify Theme Editor, allowing theme administrators to configure the background image, add interactive hotspots, and customize hotspot styles directly from the admin interface.

### Features

- **Customizable Hotspots**: 
  - Choose between CSS icons or custom SVGs.
  - Adjust colors, sizes, and symbols for CSS icons.
  - Dynamically display product details.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices with customizable device targeting.
- **Intuitive Admin Controls**:
  - Add hotspots via the theme editor.
  - Configure position, styles, and linked products visually.
- **Dynamic Content Display**: Displays product details when a hotspot is clicked.

### Files

The feature consists of the following files:
- **Liquid**: Contains the schema and HTML for the lookbook and hotspots.
- **JavaScript**: Manages interactions, animations, and dynamic positioning of product details.
- **CSS**: Defines styles for hotspots, product detail cards, and responsive layouts.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Add the Liquid File**:
   Place the provided Liquid code into the desired Shopify theme section. This code defines the schema and renders the lookbook with hotspots.

2. **Add JavaScript**:

(By default it is in the `lookbook.liquid` file)

   ```html
   <script src="{{ 'lookbook.js' | asset_url }}" defer></script>
   ```

3. **Add CSS**:
   Save the provided CSS file in the `assets` folder and link it in the same section. 
(By default it is in the `lookbook.liquid` file)

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ 'lookbook.css' | asset_url }}" />
   ```

4. **Configure in Theme Editor**:

### Testing Instructions

#### **1. Hotspot Functionality**
- Add a hotspot and link a product.
- Verify clicking the hotspot displays:
  - The product image, title, price, and link dynamically.

#### **2. Positioning**
- Add multiple hotspots with different X/Y positions.
- Check that hotspots are positioned correctly on the background image.
- Test near the edges and ensure they don't overflow the viewport.

#### **3. Mobile Responsiveness**
- Resize the viewport below the breakpoint (default: 1024px).
- Verify the product detail card appears centered and displays correctly.

#### **4. SVG and CSS Icons**
- Test both SVG and CSS hotspot options.
- For CSS icons:
  - Change the color, size, and symbol.
  - Toggle the symbol on/off.
- For SVG icons:
  - Upload different SVGs and adjust their sizes.

#### **5. Closing Behavior**
- Test the close button to ensure it hides the product detail card.
- Click outside the card to ensure it also closes correctly.

### Debugging Tips

- **Hotspot Positioning**: Use browser developer tools to verify `top` and `left` styles.
- **Product Details**: Ensure products linked to hotspots have valid data (image, price, etc.).
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Test on multiple devices to confirm responsiveness.

### Customization Example

You can customize the script by modifying settings during initialization:

```javascript
new LookbookInteractive({
  cardMargin: 0.2,
  fadeDuration: 500,
  cardTopOffsetFactor: 0.7,
  cardBottomOffsetFactor: 0.4,
});
```
